# Travelling sales man(TSP) using SOM
 
## In this code, we illustrate the use of linear topology for the cluster units in a Kohonen self-organizing map to sole a classic problem in constrained optimization, the so-called traveling salesman problem(TSP). The aim of the TSP is to find a tour of a given set of cities that is of minimum length. A tour consists of visiting every city exactly one time, and then returns to the starting city(point). The net has a linear topology, with the first and last cluster units. 

This code is implemented by Mustafa Mohammadi, student of University of Tehran.
